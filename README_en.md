# Image Retrieval System
 <strong>[ä¸­æ–‡](./README.md) |
    English</strong>
## ðŸŒŸ Introduction
This project is an image retrieval system based on DINOv2 and CLIP models. It uses Chroma vector database to support both text-to-image and image-to-image retrieval.

## Todo
- [x] support embedding database
- [ ] using rust language achieve
- [ ] support different models to extract image features and text features
- [ ] support rpc agreement
## ðŸš€ Features
- Image feature extraction using the DINOv2 model for image-to-image search
- Text-to-image search powered by CLIP model
- Support for different sizes of DINOv2 models (small, base, large, giant)
- Image retrieval based on cosine similarity
- Web interface built with FastAPI
- Uses Chroma vector database to retrieval images

## User Interface

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zheng0116/ImageRetrieval.git
cd ImageRetrieval
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
sh run.sh install
```

3. Download the Dinov2 weights:
```bash
https://pan.baidu.com/s/1fBVgg_o8PTFEu_2vtLY25Q
Extraction code: f9ww
```

4. Configure environment variables:
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:
```bash
SERVER_URL="0.0.0.0"
SERVER_PORT=5999
MODEL_PATH="./Dinov2_model/dinov2-small"
MODEL_SIZE="small"
DATABASE_FOLDER="./quary"
```

## Usage

1. Prepare your image database by placing images in the `quary` folder (or specify a custom folder in .env).

2. Run the application:

```bash
sh run.sh start
```

3. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5999`.

4. Search Methods:
   - Image-to-Image: Upload an image and click "Start Search"
   - Text-to-Image: Enter text description in the search box and click "Text Search"

## Configuration

You can configure the following parameters in your .env file:

- `SERVER_URL`: Server IP address (default: "0.0.0.0")
- `SERVER_PORT`: Server port number (default: 5999)
- `MODEL_PATH`: Path to the DINOv2 model (default: "./Dinov2_model/dinov2-small")
- `MODEL_SIZE`: Size of the DINOv2 model (choices: small, base, large, giant; default: small)
- `DATABASE_FOLDER`: Path to the image database folder (default: "./quary")
